# Chip8-Emulator

Cant pass all tests for 4-flags.ch8

Its pretty much working for other roms and games are working fine. But I just found that there is problem with some games and for some i need to enable [load_store_quirk] and [shift_quirk] (shift_quirk was implemented in order to run Space Invaders)

TODO:
Better shift_quirk and load_store_quirk
