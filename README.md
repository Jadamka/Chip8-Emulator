# Chip8-Emulator

Its pretty much working for many games, only games that are not working are those on which i need to implement load_store_quirk (Astro Dodge)

Audio was implemented using Beep function from windows.h

Also while playing tank.ch8 i noticed sometimes while playing it crashes with access violation. When I am using modulo in DXYN i add -1 to WIDTH and HEIGHT, the error seems to be fixed, but I am not sure. I still need to look into it
