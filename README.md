# Chip8-Emulator

Its pretty much working for many games, only games that are not working are those on which i need to implement load_store_quirk (Astro Dodge)

Audio was implemented using Beep function from windows.h

Also while playing tank.ch8 I noticed sometimes it crashes because of access violation.
